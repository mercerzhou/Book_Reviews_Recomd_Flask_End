# APAN5310 Group 3 - Final Project Repository

Welcome to the repository for APAN Group 3's final project!

## Project Description

This repository contains all the essential files and scripts for our data processing and database insertion tasks. The work presented herein represents a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that we've designed for our final project.

## Instructions

1. Our primary code for the ETL process is located in the file named `full_code_run_through`. Please refer to this file for a comprehensive walkthrough.

2. The `full_code_run_through` is organized into two main sections:
   - **First Part**: Data Reading, Cleaning, and Transformation
   - **Second Part**: Database Insertion
   
   Together, these two parts complete the entire ETL process.

3. Before executing any scripts, ensure that you modify the `connection_string` variable within the aforementioned file. This string should match your PostgreSQL configuration to ensure proper connectivity.

4. Once the connection string is correctly configured, running through the `full_code_run_through` file will process the data and insert it into your PostgreSQL database.

Thank you for visiting our repository, and please let us know if you encounter any issues!
